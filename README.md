# CloudMaker
## FACT minecraft bukkit server for the Minecraft of Things: Teaching and Engaging with IoT through game culture frameworks
For Minecraft PC client version `1.7.9` running `Bukkit-1.7.2`

![CloudMaker](https://github.com/cheapjack/cheapjack.github.io/blob/master/tumblr_files/Cloudmaker.png)

###Quickstart

Go to `Add Server` and enter a name for the server like `CloudMaker` the address `mc.fact.co.uk:25568`
**Make sure you are running client in version `1.7.9`**

On spawn you will be part of the `Default` user group outside a map of [FACT](http://fact.co.uk/). You can build pretty much anything in Creative mode as you explore the worlds via the FACT gallery entrances but PVP, lava fire, TNT ignition are banned I'm afraid. You cannot build or destroy blocks in the building but outside and in other un-protected areas build what you want. `World` is the main experimental world where all the Raspberry Juice magic happens and you can get there through the gallery 1 opening on the left..

Enter lifts to teleport to other floors (be careful not to walk back into them by mistake reversing out helps), get a drink in the bar and enter the gallery spaces to jump to other worlds.
You can look at the [server `dynmap` here](http://mc.fact.co.uk:8124)

###Background

CloudMaker and [The Minecraft Of Things](http://minecraftofthings.tumblr.com) sprang from research with [FACT](http://fact.co.uk/), [Dr Mark Wright](https://twitter.com/dr_mark_wright), [Adrian McEwen](http://www.mcqn.com/) and Paul Harter of [PrintCraft](http://www.printcraft.org/) funded by [IT as a Utility (ITaaU) Network](http://www.itutility.ac.uk) for the [CloudMaker](http://www.fact.co.uk/projects/cloudmaker-making-minecraft-real.aspx) project

###Research Outputs and Spin-Outs

CloudMaker has resulted in numerous outputs documented [here](http://cheapjack.github.io/EverythingMinecraft.html) on Ross Dalziel's AKA @cheapjack website and resulting in a range of spun out repos and research projects that use the CloudMaker server and build and extend the ITaaU research.

We are currently packaging up CloudMaker and all its 'deployable' outputs alongside [Dr Mark Wright](https://twitter.com/dr_mark_wright) writing up a paper on the project.

This will lead to releasing some open-source hardware and software into the Minecraft Education Community and wider Educator landscape.

###Plugins

You need Builder or Admin permissions to use most of the tools like WorldEdit etc. and generally you only get this if you're part of a FACT project at the moment. Leave messages on signs for `Ops` if you want to do something in particular and want to use CloudMaker to do it or raise an issue on github.
